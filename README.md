# History of SWFMachine
since flash has died, many many people were archiving swf files and swf games. Now, most people don't care for swf games anymore.
But, I know that some people still cares for swf games, so yeah, i told myself "Why don't you make a website with alot of swf games?" so yeah, it's here
now theres alot of websites that is like SWFMachine, but thanks to archive.org and ruffle.rs, you can play swf games in your browser!
but hey, consider using Flashpoint too. What if your internet ran out and you still want to play swf games? (its just 1 gb!!)
(swfgamesvault is cool too)
Remember, this is still in beta so its not going to be thattt much of swf games, but hey you can still play some! :)
